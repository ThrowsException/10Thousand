10Thousand
==========

Track your achievements. 

Malcolm gladwell stresses the 10,000 hour rule where he proposes that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in something. Counting and tracking 10,000 hours takes a long time, so lets make it fun with an app. 

Goals
Provide a learning experience for someone trying to pick up node. I've tried to keep it pretty simple but I've decided to use express because of it's ease to get going. 

Provide a fun backend to write client side applications. I hope to write multiple front ends for this much like a To-Do application.
